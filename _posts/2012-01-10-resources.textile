  title: Web testing - Resources
---

Web testing is the name given to software testing that focuses on web applications. Complete testing of a web-based system before going live can help address issues before the system is revealed to the public. [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_testing">Wikipedia</a>]

We are going to talk about web testing and how we can approach it.

Thinking at web testing as wikipedia defines we can do web testing using:
* Unit testing
* Functional testing
* Usability testing
* Client side performance testing
